# Backend Builders

**CEA Event Space Reservation System**

## 🚀 Overview

Our team, The Backend Builders, built a web-based event reservation and decision support system designed for the College of Engineering and Architecture at Howard University.

The platform transforms a manual, form-based reservation process into an intelligent system that validates requests in real time, assists users during event planning, and helps administrators efficiently manage approvals and campus resources.

## ❗ Problem

The existing reservation process relies on manual review and coordination across multiple departments. This leads to:

- Delays in event approvals
- Inefficient communication between offices
- Risk of missing safety or policy requirements
- Poor visibility into space usage and demand

The system collects information but does not assist in decision making.

## 💡 Solution

This project introduces an intelligent reservation system that:

- Validates event details in real time
- Checks room availability before submission
- Recommends rooms based on attendance
- Flags high-risk conditions (large events, outside guests, after hours)
- Notifies IT, custodial, and security services automatically
- Provides an admin dashboard for streamlined approvals

## 🧱 Architecture

**Current state.** The app today is a front-end prototype that runs entirely in the browser. Rooms and requests come from static mock data in `src/lib`, and submissions and approvals are kept in page state, so they are lost on refresh. There is no backend API, database, login, or test suite yet. See the [Project Reset Report](docs/project-reset-report.pdf) for the full assessment.

**Target architecture (planned).** The diagram below is the design the backlog delivers. Users sign in, the frontend talks to a reservation API over HTTPS, every rule runs once in a shared domain module on the server, and approvals persist to the database and fan out to the service teams. The red dashed border around the server is the trust boundary.
